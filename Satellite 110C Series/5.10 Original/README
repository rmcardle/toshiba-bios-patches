These are the instructions to upgrade the Flash BIOS in your 110CS.

(1) create a 720KB bootable DOS diskette.

(2) copy CHGBIOS.EXE, BIOFCDDT.COM, and AUTOEXEC.BAT onto that diskette.

(3) disable resume mode on the 110CS.

(4) turn the 110CS off.

(5) insert the diskette into the FDD.

(6) hold down the 'F12' key.

(7) turn the 110CS on.

(8) CHGBIOSA will report the BIOS version in the 110CS, the version on the
    diskette, and then ask if you wish to proceed.  Enter YES.

(9) When CHGBIOSA is done, it will ask you to press the computer's reset button.
    Don't forget to remove the diskette from the FDD, before you press reset.
